Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

Sum is called on the array and string input. The function returns a promise, 
which is then evaluated after the calls are complete. The first input is an array, so
the timeout occurs. The second input is a string, so the promise is rejecting and 
an error message is logged. The first, valid input then evalues, and the sum of all
the cells in the array is calculated, returned, and logged.
